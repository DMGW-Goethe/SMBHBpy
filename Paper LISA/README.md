## SMBHBpy
This code allows the simulation of an inspiral of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in a binary system by gravitational wave (GW) emission and dynamical friction due to the interaction with dark matter (DM) particles. It is possible to choose between static or rotating DM spikes. In addition to DM spikes, NFW profiles around each SMBH are also possible to use.

The SMBHB-code is an extension of the IMRI-code by Niklas Becker. See [this](https://github.com/DMGW-Goethe/imripy/tree/main).
