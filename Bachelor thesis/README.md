## SMBHBpy

This code allows the simulation of an inspiral of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in a binary system by gravitational wave emission and dynamical friction due to the interaction with dark matter (DM) particles.
The SMBHB-code is an extension of the IMRI-code by my colleague Niklas Becker
[this](https://github.com/DMGW-Goethe/imripy/blob/main/examples/circularizationDynamicalFrictionPaper.ipynb).
